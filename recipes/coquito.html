    <h2>What is a Coquito?</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico.
        In Spanish, coquito means "little coconut." The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum.
        Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog.
        In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks, beaten</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can cream of coconut</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>½ cup white rum</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine evaporated milk and egg yolks in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.

    </ol>
